# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This project involves rotating an \( n \times n \) 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in-place. The solution requires understanding matrix manipulation and implementing in-place operations to minimize space complexity.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.10
- No external modules are allowed.
- Code should adhere to `pycodestyle` version 2.8.0.

## Implementation

The algorithm is implemented in the `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py` file. The `rotate_2d_matrix` function rotates the given matrix in place.

### Function Prototype

```python
def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):
    """
    Rotate the given n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in place.
    """
