# UTF-8 Validation Project

This project involves validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The implementation requires understanding of bitwise operations, UTF-8 encoding rules, and Python programming.

## Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All your files must be executable

## Task

### Task 0: UTF-8 Validation

Write a method that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

#### Prototype

```python
def validUTF8(data):
    """
    Determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.
    :param data: List of integers representing bytes
    :return: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else False
    """
```
