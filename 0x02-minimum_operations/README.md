# Minimum Operations

This project implements a Python function to calculate the minimum number of operations required to generate exactly `n` characters of 'H' using only 'Copy All' and 'Paste' operations.

## Description

In a text file, there is a single character 'H'. The operations allowed are:
- **Copy All**: Copies all currently selected text into the clipboard.
- **Paste**: Pastes the clipboard content at the current cursor position.

Given a number `n`, the function `min_operations(n)` calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` 'H' characters in the file.

## Usage

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-interview.git
   cd alx-interview/0x02-minimum_operations
